# Device Management Web Application

## üìå Objective
A centralized web platform enabling administrators to manage organizational devices and allowing users to borrow, return, and monitor them efficiently.

## üß© Problem Statement
- Devices are dispersed across multiple locations.
- No tracking system for who borrowed which device and when.
- No visibility into missing, broken, or returned devices.
- Manual processes lead to delays and human error.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Centralized tracking of all device-related activities.
- Real-time visibility and control over device status.
- User request management and approval workflows.
- Live notification system (in-app + email).
- User-friendly interface for browsing, borrowing, and reporting.
- Reporting and analytics for administrators.
